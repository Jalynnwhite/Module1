Challenge 1: Module 1

To complete this project, I changed the div headers to semantic header, added alt to my image attributes, and rearranged the css.

After first inspecting the original website, I changed a few headers in the html code.

On line 28 I changed the div to main, which hightlights the content on the website. 
I implemented "section" to define or recognize the sections inside of the content.
I used aside to identify the side of webpage (Benefits).

On the images that displayed on the side of the webpage I added alt to the image attributes, being decriptive of each image that was being displayed.

Styles.css
Changed the "header div" selector to "Header nav" due to the changes in html.
Nav elements was created in html to represent the links on the webpage.
